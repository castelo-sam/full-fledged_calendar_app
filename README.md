# full-fledged_calendar_app

Creating a full-fledged calendar application can be quite complex. However, I'll provide you with a simple example of a command-line calendar in Go that displays the current month's calendar.

Here's the code for a basic command-line calendar:
   calendar.go

Then, run the program using the following command:
   go run calendar.go

The program will display the calendar for the current month in the command-line interface. The output will resemble the following:
  Calendar for July
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
             1  2  3 
 4  5  6  7  8  9 10 
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 
18 19 20 21 22 23 24 
25 26 27 28 29 30 31
