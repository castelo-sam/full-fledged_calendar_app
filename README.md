# full-fledged_calendar_app

Creating a full-fledged calendar application can be quite complex. However, I'll provide you with a simple example of a command-line calendar in Go that displays the current month's calendar.

Here's the code for a basic command-line calendar:
   calendar.go

Then, run the program using the following command:
   go run calendar.go

The program will display the calendar for the current month in the command-line interface.
